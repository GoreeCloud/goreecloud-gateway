# GoreeCloud Gateway Benefits

GoreeCloud Gateway is intended to give GoreeCloud one first-party, evidence-governed publication platform instead of depending permanently on a collection of unrelated reverse-proxy products and hand-maintained publication configuration.

## Operational clarity

The Service / Route / Backend model separates application intent from individual runtime instances. Explicit Internal, Private, Restricted Public, and Public classifications make exposure a deliberate decision rather than an accidental side effect of discovery.

A staged Draft → Validate → Preview → Activate → Observe → Retain or Roll Back workflow can make infrastructure publication easier to understand, audit, and reverse.

## Safety

Gateway is designed so invalid candidate configuration cannot replace known-good runtime state. Discovery proposes rather than automatically publishes. Production migration from Caddy remains reversible and evidence-bound.

Wardveil Security integration can centralize evidence about exposure risk, route/listener conflicts, TLS/certificate state, backend security, and configuration integrity without Gateway inventing a competing security authority.

## Privacy

Privacy Shield requirements give Gateway an explicit reason to minimize access logs and operational data, redact sensitive headers and credentials, bound retention, and distinguish required operational evidence from optional diagnostics.

This reduces the risk that a system positioned in front of many GoreeCloud services becomes an unnecessary collection point for private request information.

## Resilience

Control-plane/data-plane separation, last-known-good configuration, versioned history, rollback, configuration export/import, and Everkeep-aligned recovery can reduce the blast radius of administrative failures and simplify disaster recovery.

## Platform ownership

An original GoreeCloud implementation can evolve around GoreeCloud Identity, DNS, Network, Mesh, Privacy Shield, Wardveil Security, Everkeep, and Glaze UI contracts without making another proxy product's configuration model the permanent GoreeCloud architecture.

## Migration discipline

Exact source/artifact identity, configuration parity, isolated runtime/load evidence, backup/restore, rollback, listener ownership, and explicit cutover authorization provide a stronger migration model than replacing Caddy simply because a new proxy can answer HTTP requests.

## Current evidence boundary

These are intended product/operational benefits. Accepted `main` currently contains governance, licensing, and branding only. Native runtime work remains in separately governed development pull requests, Caddy remains production-authoritative, and Gateway remains Development.
